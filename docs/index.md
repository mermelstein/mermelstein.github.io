# Welcome!

I'm Daniel Mermelstein, currently [Director of Data](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dani-mermelstein) at Sylva.

## About Me

My career has been a journey through various parts of the data spectrum:

History degree → 10-person startup → go-to (AKA only) business intelligence analyst at a global non-profit → data analyst (adtech) → data analyst / data scientist (fintech) → data engineer → data everything.

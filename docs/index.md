# Welcome!

I'm Daniel Mermelstein, currently Director of Data at Sylva.

## About Me

My career has been a journey through various parts of the data spectrum:

History degree → 10-person startup → go-to (AKA only) business intelligence analyst at a global non-profit → data analyst (adtech) → data analyst / data scientist (fintech) → data engineer → data everything.

**Fun Side Projects:**

*   Automated surf forecasts for the Hudson River (yes you read that right)
*   Sportsbetting data and NBA game predictions: [https://getbloombet.com](https://getbloombet.com)
*   Personalized rowing workouts: [https://www.rowhardplan.com](https://www.rowhardplan.com)
*   VSCode plugin for a custom LLM chat tool: [https://github.com/mermelstein/e-acc-copilot](https://github.com/mermelstein/e-acc-copilot)

Beyond my professional life, I'm an avid extracurricular athlete and made it to the final round of selection for Team USA in 2015. I am a 5x Bronze medalist at the Dragon Boat World Championships.
